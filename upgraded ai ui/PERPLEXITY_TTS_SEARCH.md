**Search Prompt:**

Find the best lightweight, high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) JavaScript libraries or APIs for web browsers that:

1. Are lightweight (< 500KB bundle size ideally)
2. Have high-quality, natural-sounding voices (better than Web Speech API)
3. Work offline or with minimal API calls
4. Support UK English (en-GB) voices
5. Have low latency (< 200ms to first audio)
6. Are free or have generous free tiers
7. Work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
8. Can be integrated into a React/TypeScript web application
9. Have clear, non-muffled audio output
10. Support voice customization (rate, pitch, volume)

Compare options like:
- Coqui TTS (open source)
- Piper TTS (lightweight offline)
- Web Speech API alternatives
- Browser-native TTS improvements
- Cloud TTS APIs (ElevenLabs, Google Cloud TTS, Azure TTS free tiers)
- WASM-based TTS solutions

Focus on solutions that can replace or improve upon the current Web Speech API implementation which produces muffled audio.
