# Silence Audio File Placeholder

This file should be replaced with an actual 1-second silent MP3 file.

To create the silence.mp3 file:

1. Use ffmpeg:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i anullsrc=r=44100:cl=stereo -t 1 -q:a 9 -acodec libmp3lame silence.mp3
   ```

2. Or download a silent MP3 file from a free audio resource.

3. Place it in the `public/` directory as `silence.mp3`

The file is used to keep the AudioContext alive when the screen locks on iOS.
